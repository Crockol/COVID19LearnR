# COVID-19 Didactic experiment

This is a simple didactic experiment on basic data analysis with R, using the datasets downloaded from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control webpage:
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide

This is not a way to underestimate the suffering of this period.

Unfortunately every number here is a person that got sick or died, a tragedy.

So I want to underline that this is not playing with numbers and colors but an attempt to help people to critically look at real data with a scientific perspective.


***

This is a didactic experiment to help colleagues and other people with analysis of real world data. Big thank and support for all the people working in the clinics in this hard period.

Outside the emergency, our main activity is to study the physiology and pathology of neurodevelopment, in the lab of Giuseppe Testa at the European Institute of Oncology and the Human Technopole, University of Milan, Italy.
